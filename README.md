# open-BF720
Solution for automatic sync of weight measurements from a Beurer BF 720 scale.

##

## Description

Application will sync measurements from the scale at a predefined rate (Cron schedule). Measurements are stored by the application in a file on the RPI. Synced measurements can be retreived using the application REST API.

**NOTE**:
_A reverse proxy is only required if your are planning on using host names / domain names for access. Otherwise `IP:PORT` will work fine without it._

## Use case

This solution allows for easy storage and automatic retrieval of weight- and body composition measurements from the Beurer BF720 scale. A user only needs to weigh in, and at a predefined schedule the app will sync measurements from the scale to persistent storage (default schedule: once every 24h, at midnight).

The backend service comes with a REST-api, which is used by the frontend application.

## Backend / Frontend
Individual descriptions for the backend and frontend can be found here:
- [Backend README.md](backend)
- [Frontend README.md](frontend)

# Prerequisites
- Environment for running npm/node (see configuration/installation guide(s) below)
- Bluetooth BLE dongle **OR** Raspberry Pi with built-in BLE


# Configuring Rasberry Pi (Arch linux)

## Bluetooth

Install bluetooth pacman packages:
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy bluez bluez-libs bluez-utils
```

Check if the the kernel found the bluetooth device:
```sh
sudo dmesg | grep Bluetooth

Check that bluetooth service is running
```
systemctl status bluetooth

```

If not, enable and start the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

## NPM & Node
Install nodejs and NPM
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy nodejs
sudo pacman -Sy npm
```

Check installed versions:
```sh
# Versions
node --version
> v15.5.1

npm --version
> 6.14.11
```

## Raw access to Bluetooth device
Grant the node binary **cap_net_raw privileges**, so it can start/stop BLE advertising.
```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```

## Bluetooth
Bluetooth is supported out-of-the-box and you should not need to install any packages.

Check if the the kernel found the bluetooth device:
```sh
sudo dmesg | grep Bluetooth

## NPM & Node
_There are probably better ways to do this, but it was the first of many that actually worked._

NodeJS and NPM are not especially updated if using _apt_ (12.22.5 vs 16+), so we need perform a manual install.
This is based on the article [Install Node.js and Npm latest Version on Raspberry Pi 4?](https://officialrajdeepsingh.dev/install-node-js-and-npm-latest-version-on-raspberry-pi-4/).

**NOTE:**
If you already have node/nodejs installed, **you must install the old version before proceeding**.

First, determine which architecture (`armv7l` or `armv8l`) the device is running via:
```sh
uname -m
```

Then navigate to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and their (alternative) downloads page.
Locate the version of `Linux Binaries (ARM)` matching your architecture and _copy the link_ (right-click > copy link address).

Open a shell and navigate to Downloads or a temporary directory, then run:
```sh
wget <url to binaries>
```

After the download completes, extract the tarball via:
```sh
tar -xf <downloaded file>
```

Now, navigate into the extracted directory and remove unnecessary files:
```sh
rm CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md
```

Then we copy the rest to `/usr/local/bin` via:
```sh
sudo cp -r * /usr/local/
```

Finally we need to re-start the shell for it to properly find our new binaries.
Test that it works properly via:
```sh
node -v && npm -v
```

## Raw access to Bluetooth device
In order for node to access the bluetooth device/dongle and start/stop BLE advertising, we need to grant the node binary
**cap_net_raw privileges**. This is easiest done via:
```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
